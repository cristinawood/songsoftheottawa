This repository contains the code for my Master's Research Project at Carleton University. It is a digital data sonification of three stories from the Ottawa River's environmental history between 1880-1977.

The Python Scripts and data can be found in labelled folders "Hearing the River's Flows," "Sounds of Industry," and "On the Water."
